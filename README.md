# Promotional-Campaign-Analysis

# Introduction:-

I'm thrilled and excited 👏 to share that i have completed the Code Basics Challenge Project 9 in the FMCG domain, where i have crunched the Sales/Promotions 
data and created compelling dashboards featuring the storytelling of promotions based tangible insights 
on ATLIQ branded products under ATLIQ Mart(an imaginary sales company) in sales/promotions functions.

during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024(festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products.Now the sales director wants to understand 
which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for the next promotional period

🔷Tools and Languages Used:-

🟢Visualization Tool: Power BI

🟢Calculated Columns and Measures: DAX(Data Analysis Expressions)

🟢Ad-Hoc Business Queries: SQL Server(Query Language) and SSMS(Query Editor)

🟢Ppt Presentation, Image Correction ,Editing, Formatting-Adobe Canvas

👀Learning Skills:-

This project provided invaluable hands on experience ,allowing me to explore diverse datasets and create insightful dashboards. I have learned to transform raw data into compelling visual narratives,
enabling better  decision-making and strategic insights. The key highlights of the learnings are collecting,crunching, cleaning and analyzing sales data to showcase trends, top performing promotions, 
bottom performing promotions,top selling products(categories and sub-categories) and other key revenue metrics critical for analyzing the success of the festive campaign and to do a comparative study 
so that next promotional events can be planned to boost the growth of Organization.
